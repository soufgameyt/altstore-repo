Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console.

To use this feature, set the image type to \"Disk\" and uncheck the \"Read Only?\" option in the drive settings. Note that you may have to eject and re-mount the drive image for effect to take place. (#5079)\r\n* Removable USB devices will no longer show up as a CD drive if the image type is set to \"Disk\" (#5171)\r\n* Reverted a change from v4.2.0 where virtio bus devices were removed (this broke some people's configurations) (#5137)\r\n* Fixed an issue where when QEMU fails to start, subsequent attempts to start the VM will automatically fail\r\n* Fixed an issue where due to a race, removable drives may not be mounted on start\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue when the pointer is hovering over a toolbar button when the VM starts and subsequent clicks will toggle the button (#4843)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed an issue where a removable drive that is not marked as read-only still gets marked as read-only after restarting UTM (when upgrading from a previous version, you must eject and re-mount the image for effect to take place) (#5170)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where incorrect subnet parameters are generated for vmnet advanced settings (#5128)\r\n* (macOS) CLI: Added a new `clone` command (#5004)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a VM that is moved manually (e.g. with Finder) cannot be started (#5121)\r\n* Fixed an issue where the cursor disappears after resuming a suspended VM (#4665)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for `make`, `duplicate`, and `delete` verbs on virtual machines\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Add support for modifying certain configuration options\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Removed virtual machine properties: `notes`, `machine`, `architecture`, `memory`.
